# Options vs Variants

Both, options and variants refer to same concept of having variations of a given product (i.e. Same t-shirt model but different color).

Options are deprecated now in favour of variants and no further development will be done on them.

Options allow configuring `size`, `color` and `other` type of variations for a product.

Variants allow configuring many more parameters, including:

- Custom variation name (i.e. `neckline` for a t-shirt)
- Custom pricing (including discount)
- Custom images per variant
- ... and many more to come!

# Migrating from Options to Variants

In order to start using the new variant system you just need to contact your Ankorstore agent and we will manage everything for you.

# What will change when migrating to variants?

This is not a breaking change, so endpoints will keep returning information related to options for all the existing orders in our system as well as for all the orders created from the migration onwards.

We strongly recommend to start relying on information provided by variants section after the migration will be completed for your brand. Variants will contain information related to new features that won't be supported by the actual options system, so the information provided by options related to your order items may be incomplete.
